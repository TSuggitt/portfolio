            <h3 id="intro-desc">Greetings! I'm Thomas, a driven 22-year-old developer hailing from York and currently based in London. While my prior experience in the catering industry provided valuable insights, I'm now ready to make a meaningful impact in technology sector.

<br />

My journey into programming commenced during my time at the University of Leeds, where I studied Mathematics. It was there that I discovered the power of programming, using Python to tackle complex mathematical problems and R to analyze vast datasets. I was also fortunate enougth to use some lesser-known technologies such as SAS and SERPENT 2. 

<br />

Following my graduation, I embarked on a transformative path by joining the La Fosse Academy in October 2023 as a Tech Trainee. This experience has afforded me the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse projects, spanning various languages and frameworks. Notably, I've played a pivotal role in crafting group projects utilizing SERN and MERN stacks, with the former being a personal favorite.

<br />
<br />

I'm currently looking to expand my knowledge to Data Science and Machine learning where I'm hopeful to recover my degree knowledge of Analysis and Machine Learning techniques. Look out for new personal projects in the near future!

I have experience with the below tools and languages:
